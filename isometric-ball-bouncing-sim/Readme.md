# Isometric ball bouncing simulation

I was inspired seeing this project written in Basic Anywhere Machine (BAM) to write a port for the Atari 8-bit. The BAM version
may have been written by Chuck Veniot.

My version is written in Turbo Basic. I have two versions: One written to run in the interpreter (IBBSINT.TBS), and one that
I modified so it could be compiled (IBBSCOMP.TBS). It doesn't read as nicely, but the compiled version runs quite a bit
faster, more like what I saw in the BAM version.

Enjoy.
